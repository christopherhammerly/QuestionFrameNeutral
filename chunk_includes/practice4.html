<p>
How do you know whether a sentence fragment is grammatical or ungrammatical? Think about whether or not it sounds like natural English. Grammatical sentences sound like something you might imagine a friend or colleague starting a sentence with, while ungrammatical sentences contain a clear error that you don't think any English speaker would make. For example, "this one girl is..." is a sentence fragment that many speakers find grammatical, while "this one girl are..." is one many people find ungrammatical.

We are not interested in whether an English professor would think the sentence is a good one or not. We are more interested in how native English speakers speak in day-to-day conversation.
